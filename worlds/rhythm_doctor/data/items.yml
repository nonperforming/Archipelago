# Items are all things that can "drop" for your game.
#  This may be RPG items like weapons, or technologies you normally research in a research tree.
# Each item has a name, a code (hereafter referred to as id), and a classification.
#  The most important classification is progression.
#  Progression items are items which a player may require to progress in their world.
#  If an item can possibly be considered for logic (it's referenced in a location's rules) it must be progression.
#  Progression items will be assigned to locations with higher priority, and moved around to meet defined rules and satisfy progression balancing.
